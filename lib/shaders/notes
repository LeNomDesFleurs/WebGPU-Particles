texture storage can only be read_write if it is r32float, r32sint, and r32uint. 
you cannot use rbga

sorting shader of acerola use the texture, and bind a sampler & a store to it, the store will indeed use only one dimensional values

To output from the compute buffer to the canvas texture, I'll need to pass a writable storageBuffer to shader
and a dedicated input buffer for the texture

each function seems to be a dedicated compute shader in the sorting shader. how should I pass them ?
-> probably by defining multiple `passes` with the same `bindgroups`

may need to declare the input texture in the frame to avoid destruction. might also be the compute shader that breaks ?

edge sorting : compare pixels two by two, if they are too different go to next span

what does "too different" mean ? Sum all difference between colors, if it is > said number define is as an edge


## Rotation

> vec3 in this library uses 3 floats per but be aware that an array of vec3 in a Uniform Block or other structure in WGSL, each vec3 is padded to 4 floats! In other words, if you declare
