texture storage can only be read_write if it is r32float, r32sint, and r32uint. 
you cannot use rbga

sorting shader of acerola use the texture, and bind a sampler & a store to it, the store will indeed use only one dimensional values

To output from the compute buffer to the canvas texture, I'll need to pass a writable storageBuffer to shader
and a dedicated input buffer for the texture

each function seems to be a dedicated compute shader in the sorting shader. how should I pass them ?
-> probably by defining multiple `passes` with the same `bindgroups`
